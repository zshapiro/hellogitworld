Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed by an unseen censer [ECU: dull eyes getting wild]
And dependencies whose downloads glut my cache, and even more.
`Wretch,' I cried, `VanZyl hath lent you—by these downloads he has sent you
Respite—respite and some Red Bull from my cursed source code store
Quaff, oh quaff this can of Red Bull, and forget this source code store!'
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore." [Maven build failure]

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, build tool or devil!—
Whether useful tool, or whether bane of every coder on this floor
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this code base yet enchanted—
On this build by horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there a tool that would not own me? Tell me, tell me, I implore!"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore." [Maven build failure]

"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!—prophet still, build tool or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, by building with the Maven,
Shall I never make the claim that I retain just some control?
Could some little token of my build remain in my control?"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore." [Maven build failure]

"Be that word our sign of parting, building fiend!" I shrieked upstarting—
"Get thee back to Sonatype deep in the night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no jar file as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my project's build unbroken!—quit my central source code store!
Take thy POM from out my heart, and take thy cache from my code store!"
Quoth the Maven, "Nevermore."
